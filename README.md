# Song Sorter

This is a basic MP3/MP4a song sorter built in Python. Depending on the file's current metadata, the user has the option to use the Spotify API to populate any missing metadata.
If the song has no metadata, the user can use a Shazam wrapper to identify the song and then populate the metadata. After doing so, the songs are sorted into a "Sorted" folder with sub-folders organized by artist and album.

## Todos

- Have the option to remove duplicate songs
- Have the option to "vet" the Shazam output
- Create a GUI and desktop application.
